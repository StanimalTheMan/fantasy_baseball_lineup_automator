# About
This is a simple program that will let you set your Yahoo fantasy baseball lineup in advance by a number of a days you specify so you won't take L's from your opponents by default during that time.  Winning fantasy is hard even when you have your
best baseball players play the best on the other team. 

# Help
If you can / want, feel free to implement the program for other browsers as this program uses Firefox as the browser.  Perhaps, using the idea of this program to automate the process of setting your lineups in other Fantasy providers such as ESPN and CBS Sports can get you going.  So far, it assumes you only have one fantasy team.  Perhaps making the program headless will enable you
to set your lineups without seeing everything happen e.g. your browser opening and the entire automation happening before your eyes.  There does not seem to be an easy way
to use a different unit of time.
